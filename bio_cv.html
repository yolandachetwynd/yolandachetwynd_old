Her role was to mentor fellow teaching artists in developing advanced understanding of the specific philosophy and educational processes developed over years of Aesthetic Education practice, as it is shared among member sites of the AIAE.  The work was supported by grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and others and produced a series of seven workshops, from May 2004 to August 2006.
