            <p><strong>Venus.</strong> The goddess of love’s name
              resonates from the forming of myths into the present
              day—even finding a place in teenagers’ imaginations. Why?</p>
            <p>This series of ten oil paintings explores that
              fascinating question. My "tale" starts with the goddess's
              origin in the mists of time. Then we experience the
              creation and later rediscovery of her most influential
              manifestation, the “disarmed” Greek statue, the Venus de
              Milo. The final painting brings her into the modern day. </p>
            <p> The initial, and most essential, inspiration for these
              paintings came from my daughter. As her “Odyssey of the
              Mind” project at Newark High School (DE), she and her
              teammates created a performance focusing on the Venus de
              Milo. Caroline submitted to being life-cast to re-create
              the sculpture.</p>
            <p>As my daughter researched the topic, I became
              increasingly drawn to the history/herstory of this icon.
              Then I discovered the book <em>Disarmed: A Story of the
                Venus de Milo</em> by Gregory Curtis. And I began to
              think about recreating this story through my own artistic
              perspective. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;My approach links a number of my influences and
              interests.<br>
              • My first thought was to create a graphic novel – comic
              books intrigue me as a storytelling medium. Later I
              decided to tell the story through a series of tableaus,
              the way Hogarth did in his "Rake's Progress.”<br>
              • Eight of the pieces are inspired by Rembrandt drawings,
              which influenced the paintings in terms of composition and
              structure.<br>
              • Two are based on woodcuts that illustrated the 1939 book
              on the rediscovery of the statue, <em>La Venus de Milo et
                Olivier Voutier </em>by Jean-Paul Alaux.</p>
            <p>On my palette (a large sheet of glass) I create “pools”
              of color, and often spend hours just mixing them to find
              the right “warm” green or flesh tone —the one that
              supports the story I have in mind and enhances the drama.
              Using this range of shades, I draw with the paint, moving
              tiny amounts of pigment around the surface of the canvas.</p>
            <p>As I work, iconography, symbols, and natural features
              appear, dissolve and reappear, often viewed from different
              perspectives. They provide clues and emphasis, and link
              the segments of the story together, even if the viewer
              does not consciously “recognize” them.</p>
            <p>I also focused on the way the paintings are staged and
              the way the figures stand, with their well-defined legs
              and feet. This gives them a feeling of permanence and
              presence, and keeps them grounded in their surroundings. </p>
            <p>As I worked on this series, I was surprised by how far
              removed the paintings have become from the drawings and
              woodcuts that inspired them. The story itself forced me to
              change the paintings!</p>
            <p>By retelling the stories of the past, we can see how they
              affect the present. My paintings are a way to connect with
              our tribal history in a visual form, to explore the value
              of beauty, to answer the question of why an ageless myth
              and a statue nearly 2,000 years old remain a definition of
              beauty for us.</p>
            <p><strong>TITLES</strong></p>
            <p>1) <em>The Goddess Venus Bathes, Accompanied by her
                Entourage, on a Summer’s Evening</em>.</p>
            <p>2) <em>On the Aegean Island of Milo, the Timeless Statue
                of Venus is Carved by Alexandros, Son of Menides. </em>(80
              BC) He came from Antioch, a Roman city founded in western
              Turkey in 270 BC. The title <em>Venus de Milo</em> is a
              pun, milo meaning apple or melon. The statue originally
              held an apple in her left hand. </p>
            <p>3) <em>Alexandros Adds the Final Details to his
                Sculpture, Painting her Hair a Golden Yellow and her
                Lips a Ruby Red and Adorning her Body with Jewelry –
                Earrings, Armbands, a Crown, and a Necklace.</em> (80
              BC)</p>
            <p>4<em>) The Sculptor’s Nightmare.</em> </p>
            <p>5) <em>Casanova Visits the German Scholar Winckelmann in
                Rome. </em>(1760s)He finds him “as usual engrossed in
              deciphering the mysteries of Greek art.” Winckelmann was
              the scholar who divided Greek art into periods of
              greatness, citing the “golden age” as about 500-300 BC. He
              claimed, incorrectly, that Roman/Greek art was inferior to
              earlier work.</p>
            <p>6) <em>Olivier Voutier Discovers the Sculpture. </em>(April
              8, 1820) The young French naval officer asked a farmer
              named Yorgos to assist him in exploring ancient Greek
              ruins on the island. </p>
            <p>7) <em>The Party is Joined by Louis Brest, a
                Representative of the French Government, who Watches as
                Olivier Makes a Drawing of his Find</em>. (April 1820)</p>
            <p><em>8) The Venus de Milo, Bathed in Moonlight, Travels on
                the Bow of the Ship Estafette, Surrounded by the Crew. </em>(1820)</p>
            <p>9) <em>The Odyssey of the Mind Team at Newark High
                School (DE) Makes a Life Cast of Caroline Beston So She
